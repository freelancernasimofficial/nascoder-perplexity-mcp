# 🚀 Error-Free Installation Guide

## ✅ Zero-Error Installation Guarantee

This package is designed to install and work perfectly without any errors. Here's how:

### 🔧 **Automatic Error Prevention**

1. **Environment Validation**: Checks Node.js version and dependencies
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Works even if some features fail to initialize
3. **Post-Install Validation**: Automatically tests installation
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Every function has try-catch blocks
5. **Safe Defaults**: Works without configuration

### 📦 **Installation Methods**

#### Method 1: NPM Install (Recommended)
```bash
npm install nascoder-perplexity-mcp
```

#### Method 2: Global Install
```bash
npm install -g nascoder-perplexity-mcp
```

#### Method 3: NPX (No Install)
```bash
npx nascoder-perplexity-mcp
```

### 🛡️ **What Happens During Install**

1. **Dependencies Check**: Validates all required packages
2. **Environment Test**: Confirms Node.js 18+ compatibility
3. **Permission Setup**: Ensures executable permissions
4. **Feature Testing**: Tests core functionality
5. **Validation Report**: Shows what's working

### ✅ **Post-Install Validation**

After installation, you'll see:

### 🔧 **If You See Warnings**

**Don't worry!** The package is designed to work even with warnings:

#### ⚠️ "API key warning is normal"
- **What it means**: PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not set
- **Impact**: Analytics and models work, API calls need key
- **Fix**: `export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-key"`

#### ⚠️ "Cache system has issues"
- **What it means**: Cache initialization failed
- **Impact**: Still works, just no caching
- **Fix**: Usually resolves on restart

#### ⚠️ "Directory write permissions limited"
- **What it means**: Can't write log files
- **Impact**: Logging goes to console only
- **Fix**: Run from writable directory

### 🚀 **Immediate Usage**

After installation, you can immediately:

```bash
# Test the installation
npm test

# Start the MCP server
nascoder-perplexity-mcp

# View available models
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"perplexity_models","arguments":{}}}' | nascoder-perplexity-mcp

# Get analytics
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"perplexity_analytics","arguments":{}}}' | nascoder-perplexity-mcp
```

### 🔍 **Troubleshooting**
